/// Owns and services a channel interval for an instrument.
/**
 * Base class for the specialized channel managers IntervalChannelManager
 * and EternalChannelManager.
 *
 * ChannelManager's purpose is to own and service a channel interval
 * (ChannelManager::m_channel), relative to an instrument that wants to
 * play on it.  It is owned by some note-producing source:
 * InternalSegmentMapper, MetronomeMapper, or ImmediateNote (for preview
 * notes etc).
 *
 * Special cases it deals with:
 *
 *   - Eternal channels, eg for the metronome.  Its derived class
 *     (EternalChannelManager) just makes a channel interval that's
 *     guaranteed to be longer than the composition.
 *
 *   - Fixed channels, for which it doesn't use a channel allocator
 *     (AllocateChannels), but pretends to be doing all the same stuff.
 *
 * ChannelManager adapts to changes to the instrument, so it may become
 * fixed/unfixed and ready/unready as the instrument is changed.
 *
 * One way in which it services channels is by providing setup events (bank &
 * program, etc).  The note-producing source
 * calls it with an inserter, and ChannelManager puts the respective events
 * into the inserter and then (trusting the note-producing source to insert
 * those events) flags itself ready.
